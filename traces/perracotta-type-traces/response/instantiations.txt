With/without --allow_same_bindings, instantiations:
G(a -> XFb)
G(a -> XFe0)
G(a -> XFe1)
G(a -> XFe2)
G(a -> XFe3)
G(a -> XFe5)
G(a -> XFe6)
G(a -> XFe7)
G(a -> XFe8)

---

NOTE: a weaker LTL specification, G(x -> Fy) would lead to redundant
instantiations, i.e., G(e0 -> Fe0) with --allow_same_bindings
