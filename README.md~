# Texada Readme

### Directory Structure

Texada
   /bin  -- contains top-level makefile object files
      /src -- contains src objects
      /tests -- contains test objects
   /src -- source code for main project
   /tests -- main project tests

### Required Libraries

Texada relies on two non-standard libraries, [SPOT](http://spot.lip6.fr/wiki/GetSpot) and [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/). Google Test can be used in Eclipse if the C/C++ Unit Testing Support item, which can be installed from CDT Optional Features in the Eclipse Install New Software Dialogue.

### Building the project

#### Building From Shell:

Navigate to Texada/bin/. Four environment variables must be set: 
SPOT_LIB: the location of the spot library
SPOT_INCL: the location of pot header files 
GTEST_LIB: the location of gtest and gtest_main libraries
GTEST_INCL: the location of gtest header files
This can be done via the export command. Then run make in Texada/bin/.

#### Building From Eclipse:

Right-click on the Texada project and click "Properties" Under C/C++ Build, uncheck "Generate Makefiles automatically" and set the build location to bin. Then expand Build and click on Build Variables. There, add the four variables described above. They should all be of type string.
