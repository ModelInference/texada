        Texada is a tool for mining temporal specifications from program traces
    </p>

    <p>Texada mines temporal relations from totally-ordered sequences of events. To use Texada you
        need to provide it with at least the following two inputs:
    <ol>
        <li>
            A user-defined linear temporal logic (LTL) formula whose atomic propositions are variables. We call
            this a property type.
        </li>

        <li>
            A text file containing multiple traces, each of which is composed of a totally ordered sequence of
            events. We call this a log.
        </li>
    </ol>
    Texada's output is a set of LTL formulae that are instantiations of the input property type. That is, in an
    instantiation, the variable atomic propositions are replaced with events from the log. Each formula in the
    output satisfies all of the input traces in the input log. That is, each formula evaluates to true over each
    of the traces.

    <p class="lead">Texada is a research tool designed for extracting patterns from text data.</p>

    <p>Specifically, Texada mines temporal relations from totally-ordered sequences of events. To use
        Texada you need to provide it with at least the following two inputs:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>A user-defined linear temporal logic (LTL) formula whose atomic propositions are variables.
            We call this a property type.
        </li>
        <li>A text file containing multiple traces, each of which is composed of a totally ordered
            sequence of events. We call this a log.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Texada's output is a set of LTL formulae that are instantiations of the input property type. That
        is, in an instantiation, the variable atomic propositions are replaced with events from the log.
        Each formula in the output satisfies all of the input traces in the input log. That is, each
        formula evaluates to true over each of the traces.</p>

    <p>As an example, consider the LTL property type that encodes the "x always followed by y" temporal
        relation between "x" and "y": G(x -> XF(y)). This property states that whenever an event of type
        "x" appears in a trace, it must be followed in the same trace by an event of type "y". Given an
        input log with two traces: "a,b,a,b,c" and "c,a,b,b", then Texada will output the property
        instantiations G(a -> XF(b)). That is, in the input two traces, "a is always followed by b".</p>
